Welcome to Color Swiper!
This point of this game is very similar to Hack Club's Swiper (https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/master/workshops/swiper/README.md) but is for the web.
Random color objects appear on the screen, and you must point the object to the right side of the screen. Each side represents one color, if you choose the wrong side, you lose.

This website has been created with HTML, CSS, jQuery
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, what builds your website.
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet -> What dresses your website, what puts in all the beautiful colors and shapes, that is CSS.
jQuery is a framework -> another version of Javascript, which enables you to make your website interactive.

Main objectives: Teach how CSS works with HTML and how to create a simple jQuery program which can be used for many functionalities.


This game has been built and created by the SMHS Programming Club.
